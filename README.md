**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✓] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [✓] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [✓] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [✓] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [✓] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [✓] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [✓] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✓] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [✓] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [✓] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [✓] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [✓] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [X] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [X] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [X] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used mozilla to learn more about the math.random() function in order to implement the optional random pattern.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The main challenge was learning each of the languages that were used for the first time, and understanding it. Not working with any of these languages
prior to this, I wanted to understand what the purpose of each line was so I can expand what I know. Coding a submission like this is very new to me, and
I was puzzled on how it worked at first. It took some time to realize what each line did at first, and it also was challenging as I was learning three
different languages at once going back and forth, but it benefited me later on, as one of the buttons was not working properly at first, but because 
I went through the code line by line, it helped me figure out the problem, along with debugging. Without going through the code line by line, it would 
have taken me a much longer time than it actually did. I also wanted to learn more about the math.random() function that I used to keep the pattern of
the game changing every time the game started, so I researched it myself and had to understand how it worked, as it was something I was not used to in
other langauges. Although my project is not perfect, I am proud of the challenges that I overcame.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have done not much in the world of web development, but being introduced to it now I am intrigued by it. It facinates me how everything just works
together seemlessly, and want to know how different languages interact and understand each others language, for example in this code, how the buttons
were used in both html and javascript. Besides that, I want to know how a project can get a web page for itself, and how the site is made for the project.
Being new to this field, it is very intriguing and I have a lot of questions about the inner workings behind everything.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[My project definitely has a lot of flaws that I most likely overlooked, so I would first spend the time finding those mistakes. I would then make try and
make the layout and style a lot better than it is now, and I would most definitely try to learn a lot more about the languages used in this project so I
can complete the other tasks that seemed a bit difficult to me, such as the timer. I would mostly work on the layout of the project, as it looked very
"bare-bones" to me. If I had more time, I would work on a lot of different aspects of this project, depending on the time that was given to me.]
